**Data Analysis of Multiple Datasets Using ML**   *Mar. 2023 – June. 2023* <br>
● Cleaned and prepared 11 medium-sized numeric and non-numeric datasets using Python; applied linear 
regression models to find relationships between multiple variables such as significance <br>
● Utilized validation and cross-validation to choose between different machine learning models; applied 
among regression models, decision tree, random forest, and K-NN model for the best performance <br>
● Applied basic statistics and hypothesis testing concepts to measure statistical significance; discussed 
ethical issues in the data analysis process
<br> <br>
**Contains all the jupyter notebook files from Spring Info 370 class** <br>
Through this class I've learned how to <br>
● Know the data science process and some of the ethical issues you may encounter on the way. <br>
● Use python for data science tasks. <br>
● Clean and prepare medium-sized datasets, be able to use non-numeric data. <br>
● Have an overview of basic statistics and hypothesis testing. <br>
● Use and interpret simple data analysis’ methods, in particular regression models. <br>
● Do validation/cross-validation to choose between different models. <br>
